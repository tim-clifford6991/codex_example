# Inbox CoPilot

Inbox CoPilot is a concept email productivity workspace that showcases how an AI chat assistant can streamline busy inboxes. The single-page experience includes mock Gmail account connections, live processing metrics, an interactive insight feed, and a conversational assistant that helps triage, summarize, and schedule next steps from your email flow.

## Features

- **Gmail connection management** with connection status, synced statistics, and multiple account support.
- **Processing dashboard** that visualises emails processed, prepared drafts, and focus time saved alongside the latest AI insights.
- **AI command console** where you can ask the assistant to summarise threads, create tasks, and generate plans using contextual insights.
- **Workspace views** for email previewing, smart reply composition, and calendar/task management with quick actions.

> **Note:** This project is a front-end prototype. All data is sample content running locally in the browser—no real Gmail data is accessed.

## Getting Started

Open the `index.html` file in your browser, or start a simple web server (for example, `python -m http.server`) from the repository root to explore the demo experience.
